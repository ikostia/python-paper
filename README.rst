This document is a so-called analytic report on Python programming language.
It is prepared as a paper required by one of the tutors in Kyiv National Uni.

While it is based on author's experience and opinion, it clearly cannot be
used either in educational purposes or in order to be a reference in
arguments. The main idea of this document is to give a brief overview of
Python programming language for people who have *no* intention to learn it.
